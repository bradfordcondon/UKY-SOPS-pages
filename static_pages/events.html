<p>SOPS organizes a wide variety of professional development and social events throughout the year.  In addition, In June of each year we hold a Research Symposium open to graduate student and postdoc presenters. </p>
<p>
Events are open to all but tend to be especially interesting to postdoctoral scholars and fellows, visiting fellows, and upper-level graduate students.
